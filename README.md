This project contains changes to the Marlin firmware version 1.1.9.1 to adapt it to a functional 3D printer prototype that uses the Arduino Mega 2560 platform and the Ramps board version 1.4.

**ABSTRACT**

This work presents the construction of a low-cost 3D printer. The main objective is to
implement the assembly of the solution using low-cost parts, with open source hardware and
software. The initial idea was to make a laser engraver based on a prototype of a Computer
Numerical Control (CNC) router, but for safety reasons due to laser beam emission, it was
decided to build a 3D printer. The prototype consists of a physical structure of recycled wood,
low-cost mechanical structure and hardware based on the Arduino Mega 2560 and Kit Ramps
1.4 boards. The methodology consisted of bibliographic reference and was divided into
mechanical, electronic and logical parts, until the prototype was functional. Much of the time
of the project was used for testing and fine-tuning the prototype. All stages of the process were
extensively documented in a sequential manner and detailed by means of technical drawings in
three dimensions. In the results section, various types and techniques of 3D printing are exposed
with their results commented and evidenced. This prototype has a differential of the Z axis
having only one stepper motor to perform the movement that promotes reduction in cost, weight
and complexity. Finally, the results obtained through the tests carried out demonstrate that the
work developed achieved its objectives.
